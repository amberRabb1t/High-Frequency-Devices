# High-Frequency-Devices
The projects cover a range of concepts concerning High Frequency circuits.

These include reflection coefficient and SWR calculation, impedance matching, frequency analysis, antenna design, eletromagnetic wave propagation and more.

The solutions involve both theoretical (Smith chart, mathematical analysis) and computational (MATLAB) methods.
