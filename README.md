# High-Frequency-Devices
The report documents as well as the code comments are all in greek. The assignments cover a range of concepts concerning High Frequency circuits.

These include reflection coefficient and SWR calculation, impedance matching, frequency analysis, antenna design, eletromagnetic wave propagation and more.

The solutions involve both theoretical (Smith chart, mathematical analysis) and computational (MATLAB) methods.
